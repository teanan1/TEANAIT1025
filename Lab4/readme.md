Python IDLE

The difference between the interactive shell and file editor is that the interactive shell runs python instructions one by one and shows you the results instantly, this is often used for seeing what instructions do. The file editor runs complete codes for python, used when more experienced. the interactive shell also brings up a trile angled prompt while the file editor does not.
