Introduction to Networking 

 Data Transmission 

The term packets matches with the definition unit of data. packets are units on data transmitted over the internet. The term packert switching matches the definiton Technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destination address. packet switching is when a message’s packets are sent on the Internet, routers try to find the optimal route for each packet. The term IP Address matches with the definition Unique identifying number. For example the domain  Dell.com has the IPv4 address 107.23.196.166. The term DNS matches with the definition Directory of IP address common names.  For example 54.239.26.214 might be the IP address of amazon.com which is the domain name. DNS acts as the directory of websites on the Internet. The term Protocol matches the definition a Set of rules to allow devices to communicate. For example, File Transfer Protocol (FTP) are the communication rules for transferring files from one host to another.


Networking Hardware 
The benefit of a switch rather a router would be that a switch is intelligent, it is capable of storing ip adresses and sends off data packets to the ip addresses stored. The benefit of a router over a switch is that a router is more intelligent, is able to read data packets and send data packets outside of local networks using the internet.

 Network Topologies 
 
 A single point of failure is when a failure in one part of a system causes failure of the entire system. The topologies that experience this are ring topology, star topologys and bus topology
 
 both the Infrastructure Topology and Wireless Mesh have motors that connect to a switch , both consist of wireless access points. I perfer the wirless mesh connection. I say this because it allows for better timeing and less hassle rather than the infrastucture topology that would require multiple cable connections.
 
 
Network Design

The topology I choose to demonstate is frastructure Topology.  My network diagram consists of two computers, a printer, a router,and a wireless access point. The router connects to a switch , which is connected to two computers and a wireless access point.The wireless access point connects to wirelessly to a printer and a laptop.

NSA/CSS 

The NSA Cybersecurity prevents and eradicates threats to U.S. national security systems with a focus on the Defense Industrial Base and the improvement of our weapons’ security. Through our Cybersecurity Collaboration Center, NSA partners with allies, private industry, academics, and researchers to strengthen awareness and collaboration to advance the state of cybersecurity.

Cybersecurity and Encryption 

Information Systems Security 

if I were aprt of an amazon online chat , the information security traid "Confidentiality" would play a big role when speaking with customers about account access. As a worker I would have to make sure that no one could access any account information with acception of the person themselve. " Integrity" would play a fair role, for example I would have to make sure that all data is maintained correctly or with no modifications. "availablity" I would have to make sure that at all times customers wil be able to access their account and all account information.

One daily taks that reqiures auehtification would be opening my phone. for axample I have to enter a code or use face regconigtion to get into my phone in order to use it. Another daily task that requires authentification wold be checking my emails. For axample I have to enter a passcode in order to access my account. The last example would be buying items at the store using credit car or apple pay, you have to enter a passcode for that as well.

ACL or Access control list is executed after authentification is verified. It identifies who can acess the account information and if the have the ability to change,read,delete or add components. one advantage of this is that it correctly maintains the confidentiality of the users account. One disadvantage would be that it may fail in the Availability apect.

RBAC or Role based access control is an improved version of ACL. RBAC both identifies who can do what and lets them have access instead, of gving users access rights to an information resources. one advantage of RBAC is that it highly maintains the Availability aspect but may have small failures in the interigrety and Confidentiality aspect.

we need public key cryptography because in order to keep all data secure their will need to be encryptions to stop others from getting it.

Cybersecurity and Encryption

my encrypted message was "hello". when clicking the spinner the letter "A" puts out an encrypted message the same as the actual message I typed. other letters sent actual encrypted messages; when the spinner is on b the encryption of hello is "ifmmp".

when typing in my sentence I noticed that the alaphabet letter bars on the graph go up as I type each letter. For example my sentence contains 5 e's as I type the letters e the bar goes up. If it were in french the letter counts would differ do to the fact that some lanuages are more abstract when it comes to spelling , others are more complex and reqires more letters.

Polyalphabetic cipher is a cipher using multiple alphabets to encrypt.

The phrase I typed is "hello my name is teana", with the shift word as state.

brute force

A brute force attack is performed using trail and error to hack accounts. Brute force relates to kerckhoffs's principle because it gives principles that promote a secured cryptosystem.
