Introduction to Networking 

 Data Transmission 

The term packets matches with the definition unit of data. packets are units on data transmitted over the internet. The term packert switching matches the definiton Technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destination address. packet switching is when a message’s packets are sent on the Internet, routers try to find the optimal route for each packet. The term IP Address matches with the definition Unique identifying number. For example the domain  Dell.com has the IPv4 address 107.23.196.166. The term DNS matches with the definition Directory of IP address common names.  For example 54.239.26.214 might be the IP address of amazon.com which is the domain name. DNS acts as the directory of websites on the Internet. The term Protocol matches the definition a Set of rules to allow devices to communicate. For example, File Transfer Protocol (FTP) are the communication rules for transferring files from one host to another.


Networking Hardware 
The benefit of a switch rather a router would be that a switch is intelligent, it is capable of storing ip adresses and sends off data packets to the ip addresses stored. The benefit of a router over a switch is that a router is more intelligent, is able to read data packets and send data packets outside of local networks using the internet.

 Network Topologies 
 
 A single point of failure is when a failure in one part of a system causes failure of the entire system. The topologies that experience this are ring topology, star topologys and bus topology
 
 both the Infrastructure Topology and Wireless Mesh have motors that connect to a switch , both consist of wireless access points. I perfer the wirless mesh connection. I say this because it allows for better timeing and less hassle rather than the infrastucture topology that would require multiple cable connections.
 
 
Network Design

The topology I choose to demonstate is frastructure Topology.  My network diagram consists of two computers, a printer, a router,and a wireless access point. The router connects to a switch , which is connected to two computers and a wireless access point.The wireless access point connects to wirelessly to a printer and a laptop.

NSA/CSS 

The NSA Cybersecurity prevents and eradicates threats to U.S. national security systems with a focus on the Defense Industrial Base and the improvement of our weapons’ security. Through our Cybersecurity Collaboration Center, NSA partners with allies, private industry, academics, and researchers to strengthen awareness and collaboration to advance the state of cybersecurity.
