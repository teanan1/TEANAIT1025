Hardware
Hard drives and memory

the difference between latency and transfer rates is that , latency is the wait in which the disk rotation takes to get to the read- write head. Transfer rate is the time it takes for the data to travel to a location.

SSD also known as solid state drives does not consist of latency, does not need a certain amount of air support to work properly and is less likely to face manage if dropped. Hard disk drives are easily interrupted by dust, carries a latency time and faces damage if dropped.

A low ram decreases memory that is sent to the cpu, this may cause data to be sent back to the hard drive which causes delays in your computer. By increasing the ram , it increase your computers performance.

64 bits of data is in-deed faster, the more dits sent at one clock cycle the faster the computer works. 32 bits of data is slower because of the small amount of bits sent per clock cycle.


ALU and the Control Unit

The control unit takes what some would call commands,if the command invovles mathmatics or comparisons they are sent to the ALU also known as the arithmetic logic unit. This unit solves an ouputs the data, sending in back to the control center.


CPU, Input & Output

after scanning items  self check, the amount goes to the inpt, it is then computed to binary form, the data is stored in the memory and the cpu calculates the data sending it to output , displaying the total.


Logic Gates and Circuits

The purpose or function of a truth table is to explain the possible outcome of specified logic function.
The nand gate and, and gate both contain outcomes where 3 of the same output are repeatitive and one outcome is opposite.


IEEE

IEEE is one of the largest organizations that soley electrical and electronic engineers, including those of science, meds and technology professions. IEEE was designed to support professoinals in specified feilds with technology that underlies modern civilization. 

Data Representation
Numeric Conversions

the difference between decimal, binary and hexadecimal is that a decimal is to be deconstrusted, binary is a way of representing numbers using power of 2, a hexadecimal is used to represent a number using a power of 16.

Hexadecimal Color Representation

the color #ab00ff is the color purple. it is made up of 67.1% red,0% green, 100% blue, 32.9% cyan, 100% magenta, 0% yellow and 0% black.
This color would be very problematic, i say thijs because the color cannot be correctly seen my vision impaired people. This color can be intrupted many different ways by people with medcial conditions , disabilities and more.


software

Theoperatingsystem manages the hardware creating the bridge orinterface between the hardware and user.
The application executes a specific goal such as word processing, calculations on a spread sheet or surfing the internet usong your favorite browser.
Utility software includes progams that allow you to fixor modify your computer in some way, like an anti virus.
 
 ERP is asoftware that utilizes a central data base that is implemented through out the enire organization.
 
 Virtulization
 virtualization allows various operating systems and applications to run on the same serve which creates higher efficency when it comes to hardware.
 The difference between virtulization and cloud computing is that cloud computing is the enviorment and virtulization is the technology withtin the enviorment.
 
 python
 pseudo-code is used to help programmers create algorithms and plan out apps beforewriting them.
 The differences between a interperted langauge and complied language is that complied language takes a program in whole, translates and executes, a interpreted anguage takes lines of codes without translating.
 
 Career explorations
 College Central
 
during my research on bls.com , i found that my career in goal requires a bachelor's degree, has about 50,000 new jobs , has much a faster average growth and makes 80,000 and up per year. No training is required.

ceritifcations 

while exploring cerifications in i.t , I found that cisco is used as a starting point for entering the feild of informational technology. I also found that cissp is widely otained by those havehave experiance in security practices. CompTIA is a new test in factit hasnt come out yet. CompTIA is a intermediate feild that is obtained for high stae cybersecurity.
 
 co-opps
 
 To get co-opp i would need to do alotof reflection to deteremine rather i.t will be my set feild. I would explore skill sets and readiness as far as my ability to grasp what all is beig taught in our i.t class. 

Industry Associations / Student Organizations

The student organiztion i chose to pick is Black American council. The purpose of B.A.C is to provide programs to support student rententionand academic success. I believe a membership would be benefical because it will allow me to experience black networking first hand and become more in tune with black successores.
