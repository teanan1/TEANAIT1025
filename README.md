Hardware
Hard drives and memory

the difference between latency and transfer rates is that , latency is the wait in which the disk rotation takes to get to the read- write head. Transfer rate is the time it takes for the data to travel to a location.

SSD also known as solid state drives does not consist of latency, does not need a certain amount of air support to work properly and is less likely to face manage if dropped. Hard disk drives are easily interrupted by dust, carries a latency time and faces damage if dropped.

A low ram decreases memory that is sent to the cpu, this may cause data to be sent back to the hard drive which causes delays in your computer. By increasing the ram , it increase your computers performance.

64 bits of data is in-deed faster, the more dits sent at one clock cycle the faster the computer works. 32 bits of data is slower because of the small amount of bits sent per clock cycle.


ALU and the Control Unit

The control unit takes what some would call commands,if the command invovles mathmatics or comparisons they are sent to the ALU also known as the arithmetic logic unit. This unit solves an ouputs the data, sending in back to the control center.
