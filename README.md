Hardware
Hard drives and memory

the difference between latency and transfer rates is that , latency is the wait in which the disk rotation takes to get to the read- write head. Transfer rate is the time it takes for the data to travel to a location.

SSD also known as solid state drives does not consist of latency, does not need a certain amount of air support to work properly and is less likely to face manage if dropped. Hard disk drives are easily interrupted by dust, carries a latency time and faces damage if dropped.

A low ram decreases memory that is sent to the cpu, this may cause data to be sent back to the hard drive which causes delays in your computer. By increasing the ram , it increase your computers performance.

64 bits of data is in-deed faster, the more dits sent at one clock cycle the faster the computer works. 32 bits of data is slower because of the small amount of bits sent per clock cycle.


ALU and the Control Unit

The control unit takes what some would call commands,if the command invovles mathmatics or comparisons they are sent to the ALU also known as the arithmetic logic unit. This unit solves an ouputs the data, sending in back to the control center.


CPU, Input & Output

after scanning items  self check, the amount goes to the inpt, it is then computed to binary form, the data is stored in the memory and the cpu calculates the data sending it to output , displaying the total.


Logic Gates and Circuits

The purpose or function of a truth table is to explain the possible outcome of specified logic function.
The nand gate and, and gate both contain outcomes where 3 of the same output are repeatitive and one outcome is opposite.


IEEE

IEEE is one of the largest organizations that soley electrical and electronic engineers, including those of science, meds and technology professions. IEEE was designed to support professoinals in specified feilds with technology that underlies modern civilization.
