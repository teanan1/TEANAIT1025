Internet  Architecture 

Internet Protocol

 IP addresses are the numbers assigned to computer network interfaces.the difference between ipv6 and ipv4 is IPv4 has just over four billion unique IP addresses. It was developed in the early 1980s and served the global Internet community for more than three decades. Only 3.7 billion IPv4 addresses are usable by ordinary Internet access devices. IPv6 was developed in 1996 and has a 128-bit address space, which is 340 undecillion addresses.
 
ICANN is the internet corperation of assigned names and numbers. icann is used to keep up track of and maintain domain registration and ownership.
 
 TCP/IP
 
TCP/IP is used to define the details of how data is sent and received through network adapters, hubs, switches, routers and other network communications hardware. 
 
 The client server model relates to TCP/IP because the TCP/IP connections work in a manner similar to a telephone call where someone has to initiate the connection by dialing the phone. In TCP/IP communications, the IP Address is analogous to a telephone number and the port number would be analogous to a particular extension once the call has been answered.  The “Client” in a TCP/IP connection is the computer or device that “dials the phone” and the “Server” is the computer that is “listening” for calls to come in.
 
 layers are important to changing technology because each layer in technology preforms a specific task making change more convinent, rather than mutiple tasks being on one layer and when a change is made having to change the entire application.
 
 The type of applications that run on a "application" layer are initail application, transport, networking and datalink and physical.
 
 Internet Security
 
 http stands for hypertext transfer protocol. it is the protocol used for veiwing web pages. http supports the client server model because it establishes the connection.
 
 one protocol with http that protects data would be a protocol that encrypts and scrambles the data when sending it through the public internet server.
 
 you should secure your browser because not securing your web browser can lead quickly to a variety of computer problems caused by anything from spyware being installed without your knowledge to intruders taking control of your computer.
 
 one of the risks described in the article is that Web page addresses can be disguised or take you to an unexpected site.
 
  Internet Programming 
Tim berner-lee is the inventor of the World Wide Web and Director and Dr. Jeffrey Jaffe, W3C CEO. Tim created the world wide web to share files with others.

the standard I chose was Semantic Web. I chose this because stacks are what make up efficent technology and allowss room for advancement.
